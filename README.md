By: Reid Falconer, Eric Beckwith, Felix Adam and Maryam Rahbaralam

## Project Description

The data ([Dominick's Dataset](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/kilts/datasets/dominicks)) and code in this repository allows users to replicate the results found in our report "When it Hurts: Demand Estimation in the Analgesics Market" which examines demand estimation and industry pattern analysis of the market for over the counter (OTC) analgesics using a nested logit model.
